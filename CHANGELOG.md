# 2.0

- Most importantly, use `chrome.local` instead of `chrome.sync` to store access token, so **if you upgrade from 1.x, I strongly suggest you regenerate the access token for this extension**.
- Check whether repository is listed on [awesome](https://awesome.re/) repository.
- Staring repositories in different colors is built-in now.
- Redesign UI, thanks to [@sandokaishy](https://github.com/sandokaishy).
- Recreate the project with [generator-chrome-extension-kickstart](https://github.com/HaNdTriX/generator-chrome-extension-kickstart) for Webpack 2 and Babel 6.
